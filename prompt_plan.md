# Implementation Steps

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Structure

### Step 1: Initial Project Setup

```text
Create a new Vue 3 project with TypeScript support. Set up the development environment with:
- Vue 3 + TypeScript
- Vuetify 3
- ThreeJS
- Vitest for testing
- ESLint + Prettier

Create the basic project structure and implement a minimal working application that displays a blank canvas.

Key testing points:
- Verify project builds successfully
- Confirm all dependencies are properly integrated
- Basic smoke test of the application launch
```

### Step 2: Basic Canvas Setup

```text
Implement the basic Canvas component using ThreeJS:
- Create a 2D scene
- Set up the camera and renderer
- Handle window resizing
- Implement basic canvas mounting/unmounting lifecycle

Testing focus:
- Canvas renders correctly
- Proper sizing and scaling
- Cleanup on component unmount
- Window resize handling
```

### Step 3: Basic State Management

```text
Implement core state management for:
- Active tool selection
- Current color
- Basic drawing state

Create interfaces and types for:
- Tool types
- Color options
- Drawing state

Testing focus:
- State mutations work correctly
- Type safety
- State persistence during component lifecycle
```

## Phase 2: Core Drawing Functionality

### Step 4: Drawing Service Foundation

```text
Create the drawing service with:
- Basic point-to-point drawing capability
- Mouse event handling
- Drawing state management

Testing focus:
- Mouse event handling
- Point calculation
- Drawing state updates
```

### Step 5: Pencil Tool Implementation

```text
Implement the pencil tool:
- Mouse down/move/up event handling
- Line drawing with fixed width
- Initial black color support

Testing focus:
- Continuous line drawing
- Event handling accuracy
- Line appearance and consistency
```

### Step 6: Basic Toolbar

```text
Create the toolbar component with:
- Tool selection (pencil only initially)
- Basic layout
- Tool state management

Testing focus:
- Tool selection
- UI updates
- State synchronization
```

## Phase 3: Enhanced Drawing Features

### Step 7: Color System

```text
Implement the color system:
- Color selection component
- Color state management
- Integration with drawing tools
- Basic RGB palette

Testing focus:
- Color selection
- State updates
- Drawing with different colors
```

### Step 8: Shape Service Foundation

```text
Create the shape service with:
- Basic shape calculations
- Regular polygon generation
- Shape rendering setup

Testing focus:
- Polygon generation accuracy
- Shape calculations
- Rendering preparation
```

### Step 9: Basic Shape Tool

```text
Implement initial shape tool:
- Triangle drawing
- Click and drag functionality
- Size calculation
- Basic outline rendering

Testing focus:
- Shape placement
- Size calculations
- Drawing process
```

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

### Step 10: Extended Shape Support

```text
Expand shape functionality:
- Support for 3-8 sided polygons
- Shape selection in toolbar
- Shape preview during drawing

Testing focus:
- Multiple shape types
- Shape accuracy
- User interaction flow
```

### Step 11: Shape Fill Implementation

```text
Add fill capability:
- Shape fill toggle
- Fill color matching outline
- Fill state management

Testing focus:
- Fill rendering
- Color consistency
- State management
```

## Phase 5: Integration and Polish

### Step 12: Tool Integration

```text
Integrate all tools and features:
- Unified tool interface
- Smooth tool switching
- State preservation

Testing focus:
- Tool interactions
- State consistency
- Feature compatibility
```

### Step 13: UI Polish

```text
Finalize the user interface:
- Consistent styling
- Responsive design
- User feedback
- Error handling

Testing focus:
- UI responsiveness
- Error scenarios
- User experience flow
```

### Step 14: Performance Optimization

```text
Optimize application performance:
- Canvas rendering
- State updates
- Event handling
- Memory management

Testing focus:
- Performance metrics
- Memory usage
- Rendering efficiency
```

# Implementation Notes

1. Each step should be implemented with its own branch and PR
2. Every feature needs unit tests before merging
3. Integration tests should be added for major features
4. Documentation should be updated with each step
5. Each step should maintain a working application state

This breakdown ensures:

- Incremental progress
- Testable components
- Maintainable code structure
- Clear development path
- No orphaned code
- Consistent integration
